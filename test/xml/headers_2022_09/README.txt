These files are from Andy Chiu (a.chiu@sciotex.com) after modifying the LabView software to include two different header modes.

1. "Single header" mode creates a single header at the beginning of each file.
2. "Per timepoint" mode creates a header before each XYZ stack. This is the older behavior before September 2022.
